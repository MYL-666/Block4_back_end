## 🚨 CAUTION

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**:  
To insert or update books in the library, make sure to set up your **Google Books API key** first.  
This API is used in [`config/backendValidation.php`](config/backendValidation.php) to fetch book cover images from Google.  
If no API is provided, the system will raise an error. (See Figure 24 in documentation)
